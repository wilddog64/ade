## Automated Development Environments (ADE)

Ever wish Java and PHP projects were as simple as `git clone {project}; cd {project}; npm install; grunt server`? Well, now it can be.
This project will install, configure and run a development environment using Vagrant and Docker instances with minimal configuration by a development team (and no knowledge of Vagrant/Docker is required).

### \\[._.]/ - On OSX?
If you are running a mac, you might want to setup a better developer experience using [the dotfiles project](https://github.disney.com/DTSS/dotfiles) before you begin.

### Getting Started

The simplest way to get started with a fresh new machine is to download this repository as a zip file (that's right, you don't even need git!). Then do the following:

- unzip the file
- in a command line (terminal for OSX, cygwin for Windows), cd into the folder
- run `./bin/dev init`

> NOTE: OSX is currently supported, Windows is coming soon :)

### Requirements (installed via ./bin/dev init)

* git                   - for cloning this repo
* Vagrant >= 1.6.3      - to spin up and configure vagrant box to have packer and docker installed
* Berkshef >= 2.0.1     - for managing chef cookbooks
* Bundler               - for managing ruby gems

### Managing Environment

```
# basic setup
git clone git@github.disney.com:DTSS/ADE.git;
cd ADE;
./bin/dev init               # initialze working environment, setup vagrant box, and build docker a base image

# extra commands
./bin/dev start              # only spin up vagrant box and a build docker base image
./bin/dev reload             # restart vagrant box and rebuild a docker base image
./bin/dev recreate           # cleanup vagrant environment and rebuild everything
```

### Configure Mount Directories (optional)

If you need to mount directories into your node(s), you can add mount locations to mount section in config.json
By default, we will mount ~/src, assuming all your git repos are cloned under that path (if not, you can `ln -s /path/to/git/repos ~/src`).

Additionally, each node has it's own config where you can specify mount points specific for a single node!

### Node Config

Each node config can contain any of these options:

```
{
    // if there is a chef section in your node config
    // then chef will be used to create this node
    "chef":{
        // a chef cookbook repo is required
        "repo": "git://github.disney.com:DisneyID/DisneyID_UI_Chef.git",
        // also a raw link to the environment config file is required
        "env": "https://github.disney.com/DisneyID/DisneyID_UI_Chef/raw/master/environments/did-qa/UI-Desktop.json"
    },
    // specific mounts for this node only
    "mounts": [
        {
            // path is the location of the host directory
            "path": "~/src",
            // mount_point is where it will be located on the node
            "mount_point": "/var/www/html"
        }
    ],
    // any ports that should forward from your native OS into the node
    ports:[{
    	// the port inside the VM
        "guest": 80,
        // the port on your native OS that will direct into the box on the guest port
        "host": 8080
        // so with this config, you can access localhost:8080 and it will load :80 on the node
    }],
    // a shell script to add additional config to this node (after chef runs or instead of chef)
    "script":"disneyid_ui.sh"
}

```

### Pull Request Additions to the Baseline

- fork this repo to your own github account or team
- git clone your fork
- add the original as an upstream remote `git remote add upstream git@github.disney.com:DTSS/ADE.git`
- make changes in a feature branch `git checkout -b my_feature; git commit -m 'my change'; git push -u origin my_feature`
- pull-request your feature branch to this repo


### Create Your Own Docker Dev Setup!

- fork this repo into your own github profile or team account
- git clone your fork
- add the original as an upstream remote `git remote add upstream git@github.disney.com:DTSS/ADE.git`
- add files needed to build your nodes into the ./files directory
- add a script for each node you want to run locally in ./nodes
- commit and push to your own repo
- now new team members can download your fork, run `./bin/dev init` and be off running!
