## Automated Development Environments (ADE)

Ever wish Java and PHP projects were as simple as `git clone {project}; cd {project}; npm install; grunt server`? Well, now it can be.
This project will install, configure and run a development environment using Vagrant and Docker instances with minimal configuration by a development team (and no knowledge of Vagrant/Docker required).

### Getting Started

The simplest way to get started with a fresh new machine is to download this repository as a zip file (that's right, you don't even need git!). Then do the following:

- unzip the file
- in a command line (terminal for OSX, cygwin for Windows), cd into the folder
- run `./bin/dev.sh init`

> NOTE: OSX is currently supported, Windows is coming soon :)

### Requirements (installed via ./bin/dev.sh init)

* git                   - for cloning this repo
* Vagrant >= 1.6.3      - to spin up and configure vagrant box to have packer and docker installed
* Berkshef >= 2.0.1     - for managing chef cookbooks
* Bundler               - for managing ruby gems

### Managing Environment

```
# basic setup
git clone git@github.disney.com:BDE-Chef/docker_devenv.git;
cd docker_devenv;
./bin/dev.sh init               # initialze working environment, setup vagrant box, and build docker a base image

# extra commands
./bin/dev.sh start              # only spin up vagrant box and a build docker base image
./bin/dev.sh reload             # restart vagrant box and rebuild a docker base image
./bin/dev.sh recreate           # cleanup vagrant environment and rebuild everything
```

### Configure Mount Directories (optional)

If you need to mount directories into your node(s), you can add mount locations to mount.json
By default, we will mount ~/src, assuming all your git repos are cloned under that path (if not, you can `ln -s /path/to/git/repos ~/src`).

You can or modify mount points in the mount.json file like so

```
    {
        "mounts": [
            {
                "path": "~/gitrepos",
                "mount_point": "/tmp/gitrepos"
            },
            {
                "path": "~/my/awesome/path",
                "mount_point": "/tmp/otherstuff"
            }
        ]
    }

```

* path is the location of the folder on your native host
* mount_point is a mount directory inside a vagrant box, which you can use in your /node/* scripts when setting up your nodes
* these directories will be mounted on all nodes (in case you are building a multi-node project)

### Pull Request Additions to the Baseline

- fork this repo to your own github account or team
- git clone your fork
- add the original as an upstream remote `git remote add upstream git@github.disney.com:BDE-Chef/docker_devenv.git`
- make changes in a feature branch `git checkout -b my_feature; git commit -m 'my change'; git push -u origin my_feature`
- pull-request your feature branch to this repo


### Create Your Own Docker Dev Setup!

- fork this repo into your own github profile or team account
- git clone your fork
- add the original as an upstream remote `git remote add upstream git@github.disney.com:BDE-Chef/docker_devenv.git`
- add files needed to build your nodes into the ./files directory
- add a script for each node you want to run locally in ./nodes
- commit and push to your own repo
- now new team members can download your fork, run `./bin/dev init` and be off running!
